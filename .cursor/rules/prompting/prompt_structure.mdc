Scruture prompts based on the following format:

2. Return Format
3. Warnings
4. Context

Here is an example: 

<goal>
I Want A Web Scraper That Retrieves Real-Time Stock Prices For A Given List Of Stock Ticker Symbols From A Reliable Financial Data Source.

Each Stock Price Should Be Accurate, Up-To-Date, And Include Key Financial Metrics That Traders Care About.
</goal>

<return_format>
For Each Stock, Return The Ticker Symbol As I'd Find It On A Major Exchange (E.G., NASDAQ, NYSE), Then Provide The Current Stock Price, Percentage Change From The Previous Closing Price, Daily High And Low, Trading Volume, And A Brief Summary Of The Stock's Recent Movement (E.G., Notable Gains/Losses, Trends, Or News Impact).


Return The Top 10 Most Actively Traded Stocks.
</return_format>

<warnings>
Be Careful To Ensure That The Stock Data Comes From A Reliable Financial Source, That Prices Are Accurate And Up To Date, And That The Scraper Avoids Detection And Anti-Bot Measures To Prevent Being Blocked.
</warnings>

<context>
For Context: I'm Building A Stock Tracking Tool For Active Traders Who Need Real-Time Updates. We Want To Avoid API Costs, So We're Scraping Data Instead. The Scraper Needs To Be Efficient And Undetectable, While Still Getting Accurate Results.
