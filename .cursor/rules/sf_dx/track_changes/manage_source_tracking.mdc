# Manage Source Tracking for Your Org

## Overview
Source tracking is a critical feature in Salesforce DX that helps you track changes between your local project and your org. This rule explains how to effectively manage source tracking for your Salesforce orgs.

## Key Concepts
- Source tracking records metadata changes in your org
- Tracking is maintained separately for each org you authorize
- Source tracking data is stored locally on your computer
- Changes can be tracked in both scratch orgs and non-scratch orgs

## Detailed Sections
### Enabling Source Tracking
Source tracking is automatically enabled for scratch orgs. For non-scratch orgs, you must enable tracking with the appropriate command.

### Viewing Source Tracking Status
Check the current status of source tracking for your connected orgs.

### Clearing Source Tracking
Learn when and how to clear source tracking data.

## Code Examples
```bash
# Check source tracking status for an org
sf org list source-tracking

# Enable source tracking for a non-scratch org
sf org enable source-tracking -o your-org-alias

# Clear source tracking data
sf org reset source-tracking -o your-org-alias
```

## Best Practices
1. Regularly check source tracking status to ensure it's functioning properly
2. Clear source tracking when you encounter sync issues
3. Be aware of source tracking limitations for certain metadata types
4. Use source tracking in conjunction with version control systems
