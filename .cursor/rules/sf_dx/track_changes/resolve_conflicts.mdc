# Resolve Conflicts Between Your Local Project and Org

## Overview
When changes occur both locally and in your Salesforce org, conflicts can arise during deployment or retrieval. This rule explains how to identify and resolve these conflicts effectively.

## Key Concepts
- Conflicts occur when the same component is modified in both locations
- Conflict resolution requires deciding which version to keep
- Different conflict resolution strategies apply to different scenarios
- Source tracking helps identify potential conflicts

## Detailed Sections
### Identifying Conflicts
Learn how to detect when local and remote changes conflict with each other.

### Types of Conflicts
Understand the different types of conflicts that can occur and their implications.

### Resolving Local vs. Remote Conflicts
Strategies for deciding whether to keep local changes or remote changes.

### Merge Strategies
Techniques for merging changes when both versions contain valuable modifications.

## Code Examples
```bash
# Check for potential conflicts before deployment
sf project deploy preview -o your-org-alias

# Force local changes to overwrite remote changes
sf project deploy start -o your-org-alias --force-overwrite

# Force retrieval of remote changes to overwrite local
sf project retrieve start -o your-org-alias --force-overwrite
```

## Best Practices
1. Always preview changes before deploying or retrieving to identify conflicts
2. Use a diff tool to compare local and remote versions
3. Communicate with team members when resolving conflicts in shared components
4. Consider creating backups before resolving complex conflicts
5. Use source control systems to help manage conflicts
6. Document your conflict resolution decisions for future reference
