# Continuous Integration Using CircleCI

## Overview
This guide provides instructions on how to set up and use CircleCI for continuous integration with your Salesforce DX projects.

## Key Concepts
- CircleCI is a popular continuous integration platform that can be used with Salesforce DX
- CircleCI can automate testing, building, and deploying Salesforce applications
- Integration with DevHub enables a complete CI pipeline

## Detailed Implementation

### Configure Your Environment for CircleCI
1. Create a CircleCI account and connect it to your GitHub or Bitbucket repository
2. Install the CircleCI CLI for local testing
3. Set up environment variables in CircleCI for Salesforce authentication
4. Create a configuration file for CircleCI (.circleci/config.yml)

### Connect CircleCI to Your DevHub
1. Store your DevHub authentication credentials securely in CircleCI
2. Use JWT-based authentication for headless (CI) environments
3. Configure CircleCI to authenticate to your DevHub org
4. Validate the connection with a simple test job

## Code Examples

```yaml
# Example .circleci/config.yml
version: 2.1
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: salesforce/salesforcedx:latest
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Setup Org
          command: |
            echo "$SFDX_AUTH_URL" > sfdx_auth.txt
            sfdx auth:sfdxurl:store -f sfdx_auth.txt -a DevHub
      - run:
          name: Create Scratch Org
          command: sfdx force:org:create -f config/project-scratch-def.json -a scratch-org -s
      - run:
          name: Push Source
          command: sfdx force:source:push -u scratch-org
      - run:
          name: Run Tests
          command: sfdx force:apex:test:run -u scratch-org --codecoverage --resultformat json
```

## Best Practices
1. Store sensitive credentials as encrypted environment variables in CircleCI
2. Use separate environments (Scratch Orgs) for each build
3. Include automated testing as part of your CI workflow
4. Create a comprehensive config.yml that handles different branches appropriately
5. Implement status checks in your repository to enforce quality gates
