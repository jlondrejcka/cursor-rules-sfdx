# Develop and Test Changes Locally

## Overview
Developing and testing changes locally is a critical first step in the Salesforce application release cycle, ensuring quality and reducing risks before deployment.

## Key Concepts
- Local development environments isolate changes from production
- Scratch orgs and sandboxes provide safe testing spaces
- Automated testing validates changes before deployment
- Source tracking helps manage local versus remote changes

## Detailed Guide
### Setting Up Your Local Development Environment
1. Create a scratch org or authorize a sandbox for development
2. Push your source code to the development environment
3. Make and test changes iteratively
4. Track changes using source tracking

### Testing Strategies
- Unit tests: Verify individual components function correctly
- Integration tests: Ensure components work together
- UI tests: Validate user interface functionality
- Performance tests: Check for efficiency and speed

## Code Examples
```bash
# Create a scratch org for development
sf org create scratch -f config/project-scratch-def.json -a DevOrg

# Push source to development environment
sf project deploy start --source-dir force-app --target-org DevOrg

# Run Apex tests locally
sf apex test run --test-level RunLocalTests --target-org DevOrg

# Pull changes back to your project
sf project retrieve start --source-dir force-app --target-org DevOrg
```

## Best Practices
1. Create dedicated development environments for each major feature
2. Run all tests locally before building release artifacts
3. Use consistent naming conventions for development orgs
4. Document all changes during development
5. Use source control to track changes to your local codebase
