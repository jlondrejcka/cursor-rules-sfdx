# Supported Scratch Org Editions and Allocations

## Overview
Scratch Orgs come in different editions that mirror production Salesforce editions. Each Dev Hub has allocation limits for how many Scratch Orgs you can create.

## Key Concepts
- Scratch Orgs are available in different editions that match production Salesforce editions
- Each Dev Hub has allocation limits for the number of active Scratch Orgs
- Scratch Orgs have a maximum lifetime of 30 days
- Different Salesforce license types have different Scratch Org allocation limits

## Supported Editions
The following Scratch Org editions are supported:
- Developer
- Enterprise
- Group
- Professional
- Partner Developer
- Partner Enterprise
- Partner Group
- Partner Professional

## Allocation Details
- **Active Scratch Orgs**: Limited based on your Salesforce license
- **Scratch Org Duration**: Maximum 30 days before they expire
- **Daily Creation Limit**: Based on your Salesforce license

### Allocation by License Type
| License Type | Active Scratch Orgs | Daily Creation Limit |
|-------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Developer Edition | 3-6 | 6 |
| Trial | 3-6 | 6 |
| Enterprise Edition | 40-100 | 80-200 |
| Unlimited Edition | 40-100 | 80-200 |
| Performance Edition | 40-100 | 80-200 |

## Checking Allocations
You can check your Scratch Org allocations with the Salesforce CLI:

```bash
sf org list limits --target-org your-dev-hub-alias
```

## Best Practices
1. Monitor your Scratch Org usage to avoid hitting allocation limits
2. Delete Scratch Orgs when no longer needed to free up allocations
3. Consider setting shorter expiration dates for temporary development work
4. Use the `--duration` flag when creating Scratch Orgs to control lifespan
